# shannon-feature-selection

Shannon entropy/mutual information as a tool for feature selection in Data Science.

This repo houses, primarily, a blog post, and secondarily, the code required to generate the figures for that blog post.

## Written Content
You should start by reading the blog post in `Shannon Entropy.md`.  That document relies on a couple images stored in the Images subdir.

You can also read this very same blog post, complete with images, [here](https://medium.com/@manifolded/hidden-amongst-the-disorder-d48f083a6483?source=friends_link&sk=f9b35c00097eda15cdc34bdc03eb1cfd) on Medium.

## Code Content
If you came here for the code it is in the file `Mutual Information Example.ipynd`.  This is an iPython notebook, thus it is opened in Jupyter.  (In the Python world you must not question this dichotomy!)  

I installed my Jupiter whosie-whatsit using [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual) and usually don't regret doing so.
