# shannon-feature-selection

Shannon entropy/mutual information as a tool for feature selection in Data Science.

You should start by reading the blog post stored in `Shannon Entropy.md`.  That document relies on a couple images stored in the Images subdir.  You also read this very same blog post, complete with images, on Medium at https://medium.com/@manifolded/hidden-amongst-the-disorder-d48f083a6483?source=friends_link&sk=f9b35c00097eda15cdc34bdc03eb1cfd

If you came here for the code it is in the file `Mutual Information Example.ipynd`.  

Please let me know what you think.  I'd love to hear from you.
